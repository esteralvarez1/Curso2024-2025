    <h1>Dataset Requirements</h1>

        <h2>R1: Data in smart city domain</h2>
        <p>The dataset comes from Renfe, which collects data related to rail transportation services across Spain. Rail transportation is a key component of smart city infrastructure, providing insights into mobility, public transportation efficiency, and urban planning.
        </p>

        <h2>R2: Data available as a CSV file</h2>
        <p> The dataset is available as a CSV file and can be found locally in the <i>csv</i> folder of the repository. This file includes data on rail service types, routes, passenger volumes, and operational metrics such as "Plazas Ofertadas" and "Viajeros.km".
        </p>
            
        <h2>R3: Data have an open license so it can be published</h2>
        <p> It is important to verify if the dataset is provided under an open license, such as a Creative Commons or Open Data License, to ensure it can be reused for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Please refer to the data source for further clarification regarding the license.
        </p>
        
        <h2>R4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h2>
        <p>The dataset contains detailed information about rail corridors and transportation services, which are directly linkable to real-world entities like cities, stations, and transportation infrastructure. This data can be connected to geographical information systems or linked with external datasets, such as Wikidata or OpenStreetMap, to enhance contextual information.
        </p>
            
        <h2>R5: Documentation available</h2>
        <p>Currently, there is no detailed documentation provided with the dataset. However, the column names such as "Plazas Ofertadas" and "Viajeros.km" give an indication of the type of information captured. It would be beneficial to have further documentation to clarify the data structure and usage.
        </p> 
        
        <h2>R6: Multi-source data</h2>
        <p>Our dataset comes from a single source, Renfe, which is the primary operator of passenger and freight trains in Spain. However, additional transportation datasets could be combined with this one to provide a broader analysis of urban mobility.
