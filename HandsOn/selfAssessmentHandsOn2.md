# Hands-On 2 Self-Assessment

## Task Overview
We successfully completed the ontology design and instantiation for the rail transportation dataset. The data source analysis and resource naming strategy are well-defined, ensuring consistency and linkability with external data sources.

## Challenges
- Verifying the open license for the dataset required additional research.
- Defining the ontology to cover all relevant entities in the dataset was challenging due to the complexity of the relationships between stations, routes, and operational metrics.

## Next Steps
- Link the data with external sources such as geographical datasets (OpenStreetMap) and city infrastructure.
- Ensure that the RDF instances are tested and validated against the ontology.
